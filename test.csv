818,"Bond Length The distance between the nuclei of the two atoms joined by the bond is called the bond length. The length of a covalent bond between two given atoms depends on whether it is a sigma bond or combination of a sigma and π - bond or π - bonds, i.e., it is a single, double or triple bond. It also depends on the type of hybridization and the resonance. The bond length is less for a double bond than a single bond and less again for a triple bond than a double bond. Single bond ( σ - bond) > Double bond (one σ - and one π - bond) (one σ - and two π - bonds) The bond length of the sigma bond in different types of hybridization follows the following order : σ - bond ( s p 3 ) > σ - bond ( s p 2 ) > σ - bond ( s p ) Bond length between two given atoms is approximately constant in different molecules depending upon the above conditions unless it is not affected by inductive effect and mesomerism. The bond length is expressed in angstrom units ( Å ) . The bond lengths are measured by X - ray crystallography and by microwave spectroscopy. For most of the bonds the values are 1 to 2 Å . It may be noted that the values of bond lengths are subject to small changes, depending on the structural environment of the bond and the experimental method used to measure it."

Numerous reactions that occur in the bodies of animals and plants to maintain the life process are catalysed by enzymes. The enzymes are. thus, termed as biochemical catalysts and the phenomenon is known as biochemical catalysis. Many enzymes have been obtained in pure crystalline state from living cells.
